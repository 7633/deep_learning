# Deep-Learning


Presentation
---

This repository contains Deep Learning *implementations* tutorials. For more general knowledge regarding Machine/Deep Learning, have a look at **[useful_resources.md](useful_resources.md)**. 

Lasagne and Keras are Theano-based so I recommend you get familiar with Theano before starting these ones.  

However **Keras** is way closer to usual Python than Lasagne so it requires a weaker understanding of Theano. The main thing to understand to get started with Keras is Theano's graph structure.


We concentrate, in [theano.md](https://github.com/Vict0rSch/Deep-Learning/blob/master/theano.md), on a few features of Theano that will be needed in Lasagne mostly and just a little in Keras. You will not learn Theano there but get a glimpse at how it works and how it can be used in a Deep Learning context. Theano is about much more than this, especially regarding [GPU](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/using_gpu.html) calculation and [Automatic Differenciation](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/gradients.html).


See the official Theano tutorial [here](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/).

How to use
---
1. Learn about Machine Learning -> Resources -> [Resources](useful_resources.md#starting-with-deep-learning)


2. Learn about Deep Learning Theory and feedforward networks (your best bet may very well be M. Nielsen's blog)  -> [Resources](useful_resources.md#starting-with-deep-learning)

3. Get familiar with Theano -> [Theano](theano.md)

4. Get into some code 
	* Start easy with Keras -> [Keras](keras)  
	* Go into the details with Lasagne -> [Lasagne](lasagne)

5. Dig into Recurrent Networks -> [Resources](useful_resources.md#on-recurrent-neural-networks)

6. Spend some time understanding the handling of dimensions in recurrent nets -> [Recurrent](recurrent.md)

7. Get back to code -> *[on the way]*

Repository Structure
---

* **Readme.md** -> present file (I know you knew)

* **[License](License)** -> GPL v2 ([choose a licence](http://choosealicense.com/))

	> The GPL (V2 or V3) is a copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms. V3 is similar to V2, but further restricts use in hardware that forbids software alterations.

	> Linux, Git, and WordPress use the GPL. 

* **[setup.md](setup.md)** -> Links and sketchy guide to install frameworks

* **[theano.md](theano.md)** -> A short introduction to Theano with the minimum required to go on with Lasagne and Keras. 

*  **[useful_resources.md](useful_resources.md)** -> a list of recommended ressources to either begin, discover or learn more on various topics of machine/deep learning.

* **[keras](keras)** -> repository containing the tutorial about... Keras. Yep. 

	*  **[readme.md](keras/readme.md)** -> Choose between starting with feedforward networks or get deeper, into recurrent networks. 
	* **[feedforward\_keras\_mnist\_tutorial.md](keras/feedforward_keras_mnist_tutorial.md)** -> code introduction and explanation to easily run a neural network able to recognize digits (mnist dataset)
	* **[feedforward\_keras\_mnist.py](keras/feedforward_keras_mnist.py)** -> code to implement a feedforward (dense) neural network trained on mnist using keras.
	* **[recurrent\_keras.md](keras/recurrent_keras.md)** -> example using recurrent networks. Empty for now, example to come.
	
* **[lasagne](lasagne)** repository containing the tutorial about... Lasagne. Yep. Again. Repository organized as Keras's
	* **[readme.md](lasagne/readme.md)**
	* **[feedforward\_lasagne\_mnist\_tutorial.md](lasagne/feedforward_lasagne_mnist_tutorial.md)**
	* **[feedforward\_lasagne\_mnist.py](lasagne/feedforward_lasagne_mnist.py)**
	* **[recurrent\_lasagne.md](lasagne/recurrent_lasagne.md)**



The Toothbrush Technique
---
The Toothbrush technique is used to debug code. The concept is easy: pick up your toothbrush, a pen or a spoon and walk it through your code as if they understood it. Better yet use a friend or coworker: you won't need their brain, rather their ears. 

The thing is that debugging can be hard and the error might very well be silly. However looking as someone else's code is often hard and/or laborious, so asking a friend/coworker to debug it is hardly possible.  
On the other hand, explaining it to your toothbrush makes you rethink the whole coding process you went through and hopefully find that (silly?) mistake or incoherence.
