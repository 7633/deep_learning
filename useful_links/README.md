How to use
----
Here is a collection of useful resources to learn / understand / discover more about (Deep) Learning. It will be updated regularly, I'll be glad if you have  suggestions to this list. 

Resources can be either research papers, explanatory website or even a well-written Wikipedia page. Topics are wide, I hope you'll find what you need. 

Starting with (Deep) Learning
----

1. **<http://www.r2d3.us/>** A **beginner's** introduction to **machine learning**, how it works and what is at stake. The website is amazingly beautiful and didactical. If you're ehre, on *this* page, you probably won't need to read through that. But still, it's too good to miss. And worth sharing with everyone.

1. **<http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/>** This is a goldmine to start with Deep Learning and understand neural networks. It starts from scratch, and takes you through the **backpropagation** algorithm, **regularization**, tips to train your networks etc. up to explaining **convolutional** networks and introducing recurrent ones. It needs very little maths and uses a simple Python code to wallk you through the **implementation** of feedforward and convolutional neural nets.

	_This is where I started and I want to **thank** **[M. Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/)** for his very informative and pedagogical work._
	
2. **<https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning>** Here is [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)'s most famous MOOC on Coursera. Again, this is a "*start-from-scratch*" ressource, it needs little maths and is easy going with coding.  The point here is to teach about **machine learnin**g in general, amongst which stand neural networks. It uses [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) (free version of Matlab) which is a downside for me *vs* Python but this is not important if you're just starting and if you're not you can always do it in Python anyway.
